# Migration Note: .htaccess File

This file was removed during the migration from Hostinger to Vercel.
The .htaccess configuration has been replaced by vercel.json configuration.

## Original .htaccess functionality now handled by:
- **API Proxying**: `vercel.json` rewrites section
- **SPA Routing**: `vercel.json` rewrites for client-side routing
- **Security Headers**: `vercel.json` headers section
- **Compression**: Handled automatically by Vercel
- **Caching**: Handled by Cloudflare CDN

## Backup location:
The original .htaccess file is backed up as `.htaccess.backup` for reference.
